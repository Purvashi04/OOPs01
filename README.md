# 🎬 Movie Ticket Booking System - C++ OOP Project

This is a **C++ console-based Movie Ticket Booking System** developed as a group project using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It allows users to view available movies, book tickets for selected movies, and handle seat selection and payments efficiently.

## 📌 Objective

To create a simple and interactive movie ticket booking system using core OOP concepts such as:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism

## 💡 Features

- 🎥 View all available movies
- 🎟️ Book regular or VIP tickets
- 🪑 Choose number of seats
- 💵 Make payment with validation
- ❌ Display error if funds are insufficient
- ✅ Show change if payment exceeds total cost
- 🔚 Exit the system cleanly

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. **Display Movies**:  
   Enter `1` to view a list of available movies.

2. **Book Tickets**:  
   Enter `2` to:
   - Select a movie from the list
   - Choose number of **Regular** and **VIP** seats
   - Enter the total amount for the booking
   - System checks seat availability and payment adequacy
   - Confirms booking or notifies if funds are insufficient

3. **Exit Program**:  
   Enter `3` to quit the system.

## Technologies Used

- Language: **C++**
- Concepts: **Object-Oriented Programming**
- Platform: **Command-line Interface**

## OOP Concepts Applied

| Concept         | Usage Description                                 |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Class**       | Defined for movies, seats, and booking system     |
| **Inheritance** | Different seat types or user roles (if extended)  |
| **Encapsulation** | Secure handling of seat data and payments       |
| **Abstraction** | Hides internal implementation from the user       |
| **Polymorphism**| Booking logic variations (extendable feature)     |
